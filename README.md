**The Classic Pack** is a resource pack for [Toontown Rewritten](https://www.toontownrewritten.com/), restoring the low-quality goodness of Toontown Online. Inspired by the 'Old Toontown Content Pack' created by [/u/jojo8624](https://www.reddit.com/user/jojo8624/).

**Note: This pack is not meant to try and hide or remove content created by the Toontown Rewritten team, only bring back what was changed from Toontown Online.**
