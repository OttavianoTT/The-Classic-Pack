# The Classic Pack
 A resource pack for [Toontown Rewritten](https://www.toontownrewritten.com/), restoring the low-quality goodness of Toontown Online. Inspired by the 'Old Toontown Content Pack' created by [/u/jojo8624](https://www.reddit.com/user/jojo8624/).

## At the moment, the pack does the following...
- Replaces the current Toontown Rewritten theme, logo and icon with the ones from BETA

- Brings back the blurrier chat/thought bubbles texture
- Restores the whisper sound effect in place of the notification sound effect
- Mutes the Cog attacks that did not have sound effects in Toontown Online
- Crudely recreated the magnet gag's texture to look as low-resolution as it was in Toontown Online
- Removes the theme created for Daisy Gardens buildings
- Mutes Clarabelle when viewing the cattlelog
- Removes the underwater music in Donald's Dock and Chip 'n Dale's Acorn Acres
- Restores some of the low-quality Cog HQ textures

- Brings back the out-of-sync running sound effect
- Restores the original pupil texture for Toon eyes
- Replaces the themes created for the Cashbot HQ lobby and mints, Lawbot offices, and the final round of Bossbot golf courses
- Brings back the original textures for the following accessories...
  - Bird Wings
  - "Gadzooks!" Goggles (formerly called Goggles)
  - Rainbow Angel Wings
- Restores the Cog Building statue to its original texture
- Restores the original teleportation hole texture
