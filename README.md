# The Classic Pack
 A resource pack for [Toontown Rewritten](https://www.toontownrewritten.com/), restoring the low-quality goodness of Toontown Online. Inspired by the 'Old Toontown Content Pack' created by [/u/jojo8624](https://www.reddit.com/user/jojo8624/).

## At the moment, the pack does the following...

- Replaces the blue magnet's texture with the red magnet's texture
- Removes the theme created for Daisy Gardens buildings

- Replaces the themes created for the Cashbot HQ lobby and mints, Lawbot offices, and the final round of Bossbot golf courses

## To-do list...
- Restore the original party cannon texture
